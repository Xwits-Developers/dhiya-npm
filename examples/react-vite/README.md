# Dhiya React + Vite Example

Minimal React template that depends on [`dhiya-npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dhiya-npm) to deliver a fully client-side RAG experience.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts Vite on [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174) with a privacy-first chatbot powered by Dhiya.

## What it Shows

- `DhiyaClient` running entirely in the browser
- IndexedDB-backed vector store seeded from a small in-memory array
- Simple React UI that asks a canned question and shows the answer

Use this as a starting point to build production widgets or to benchmark Dhiya in your environment.
